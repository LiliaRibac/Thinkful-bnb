Thinkful-bnb, a project from my time at Thinkful's Software Engineering Bootcamp, is a simulated vacation rental site. It enables hosts to rent out various properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique spaces like yachts and castles. Emphasizing a mobile-first approach, I utilized media queries and flexbox layouts to create a responsive website for desktop and mobile viewing. 

In this project, my main goal was to get better at building websites that look good on both desktops and phones. I did this by learning about mobile-first design and using tools like media queries and flexbox layouts. This helped me make a website that adjusts nicely whether you're using a desktop or a mobile device. I also got some hands-on practice writing HTML code to create different types of forms.
